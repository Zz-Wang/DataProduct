## Ideas

1. Generally predict the mpg in Auto Dataset using number of features you choose
2. Input: Number of features you want to choose
3. Output: estimation on multilinear regression based on chosen features

--- .class #id 

## Feature Selection

Regression on each feature regarding to mpg and order them regarding the p-value.  

--- .class #id 

## Illustration on THREE feature example
R codes are hiden and results are hiden. 


--- .class #id 

## Further
1. Maybe some other ways to select features?
2. Maybe apply to some other datasets?
